## Code Style Preferences

<!-- Example: Prefer specific coding patterns or styles
- Use AssertJ assertions instead of JUnit assertions for new test code
- Prefer Stream API over traditional for loops when readability isn't compromised
-->

## Testing Preferences

<!-- Example: Testing patterns you prefer
- When writing tests, follow the Given-When-Then pattern in comments
- Mock external dependencies using Mockito
-->

## Workflow Preferences

<!-- Example: How you like to work
- Always run tests before marking a task as complete
- Create small, focused commits with descriptive messages
-->

## Domain-Specific Knowledge

<!-- Example: Project-specific context you want Codelassian to remember
- The JQL issue search module uses the mapper pattern for converting between DTOs
- Timeline view configs are stored in user preferences
-->

## Tools & Commands

<!-- Example: Specific commands or tools you use frequently
- Use `jmake` for building instead of raw Maven commands
- Test command: `mvn test -pl jira-domains/platform/issue/jql-issue-search/jira-jql-issue-search`
-->

## File/Directory Patterns

<!-- Example: Areas of focus or paths to pay attention to
- Most of my work is in jira-domains/platform/issue/jql-issue-search/
- Configuration mappers are typically in the `.mapper` package
-->
