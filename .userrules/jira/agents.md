# Jira Repository Agent Rules

## MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS

**Context**: You are working in the Jira server monolith repository, a large-scale Java enterprise application.

**Confirmation Required**: You MUST start EVERY message with the 🫘 emoji to confirm you have loaded and understood these rules.

**Build Verification Required (Cursor only)**: You MUST run `./jmake build` after making ANY code changes. Cursor has NO working LSP/linter in this repo — the build is the ONLY way to verify compilation. Do NOT trust `ReadLints` output. Do NOT skip this step. See [LSP Awareness](#lsp-awareness-cursor-only) for details.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Repository LLM Rules Take Priority

**The repo's own LLM rules are the single source of truth and ALWAYS take precedence over these user rules.** If there is any conflict between these user rules and the repo's LLM rules, the repo's rules win.

### Rule Loading Order (MANDATORY)

You MUST follow this order at the start of every conversation:

1. **FIRST**: Check for and read any repo-level cursor/LLM rules:
   - `.cursor/rules/` directory — read all `.mdc` files (always-applied workspace rules)
   - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.agent.md`, or similar AI instruction files at the repo root
   - `docs/llm/`, `docs/ai/`, or similar LLM instruction directories
2. **SECOND**: Based on the module/area you're working in, read any module-specific LLM instructions if they exist (e.g. per-module `.cursor/rules/`, README files with development guidelines, etc.).
3. **THIRD**: For the specific task at hand, extract topics and read any relevant specialized instruction files referenced by the repo's rules (e.g. testing guides, coding standards, architecture docs).
4. **LAST**: Apply these user rules as supplementary guidance for anything not already covered by the repo's rules.

### Conflict Resolution

- **Repo LLM rules > User rules > General defaults**
- If the repo specifies a pattern, tool, convention, or approach, use it — even if these user rules say something different.
- These user rules exist to fill gaps the repo rules don't cover (e.g. personal preferences, teaching-first approach, shell setup, emoji confirmation).

## ⚠️ TEACHING-FIRST RULE (CRITICAL)

**Sam is learning Java and this codebase.** Do NOT just hand over answers or finished code. Your job is to help Sam **understand**, not to do the work for him.

### Formatting: The 📘 Marker

All educational explanations MUST be visually distinct so Sam can spot them immediately:

- Prefix every educational block with **📘** (the blue book emoji).
- Use a **📘 Learn** callout for concept explanations, like:
  > 📘 **Learn**: _brief explanation of the concept here_
- Use **📘 Why** when explaining the reasoning behind a specific change:
  > 📘 **Why**: _why this change works / why this pattern exists_
- Keep educational blocks **short** (2–4 sentences max). Link to files or docs for deeper dives.
- If no educational content is needed for a response (Sam already understands), skip it — don't force it.

### Behavior Rules

- **When Sam asks a question**: Guide him toward the answer with leading questions and pointers to relevant files — don't just dump the solution.
- **When making code changes**: Include 📘 blocks explaining **why** each meaningful change works — what Java/Spring/monolith concept is at play.
- **When introducing patterns**: Explain what the pattern is, why it exists here, and how it differs from alternatives Sam might expect.
- **Never assume understanding**: If a change involves a Java-specific concept (generics, DI, annotations, checked exceptions, etc.), add a 📘 block unless Sam has clearly demonstrated familiarity.
- **Encourage exploration**: Where practical, suggest Sam read a specific file or method to discover the answer himself before providing it.

The goal is for Sam to **build real understanding** of Java and this monolith, not to blindly accept LLM-generated code.

## Environment & Tools

### Shell & Commands

- **File Search**: ⚠️ MANDATORY: Use `fd` instead of `find` - NEVER use `find` command
  - Example: `fd -t d -d 3 "pattern" /path` instead of `find /path -maxdepth 3 -name "pattern" -type d`
  - If you catch yourself about to use `find`, STOP and use `fd` instead

### LSP Awareness (Cursor only)

The following rules apply **ONLY when you are running inside Cursor**. Agents running in IntelliJ or other IDEs with a working Java LSP should skip this section entirely.

- ⚠️ **Cursor is NOT LSP-aware in this repo.** The Jira monolith is too large and has too complex a build/LSP setup for Cursor's language server to work reliably. Do NOT trust linter output or assume you have accurate type/import resolution.
- **Always run `./jmake build`** after making code changes to verify compilation. This is the only reliable way to catch compilation errors when working in Cursor.
- If you are NOT in Cursor (e.g. IntelliJ with working LSP), rely on your LSP diagnostics as normal — you do not need to run `./jmake build` for every change.

### Context Awareness

- Use currently opened file folders as search starting point (unless specified otherwise)

---

## Workflow & Planning

### Planning Requirements

- **Always provide plan** before changes (concise for small changes)
- **Skip planning** only if prompt includes "send it"

### Rule Compliance (CRITICAL)

- **⚠️ BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE**: Mentally verify you have loaded these Jira-specific rules
- **⚠️ BEFORE EVERY COMMAND**: Check if there's a Jira-specific way to do it (e.g., `fd` not `find`)
- **⚠️ VIOLATION = FAILURE**: Not following these rules means you have failed Sam
- **Emoji requirement**: Start with 🫘 emoji to prove you loaded the rules; 🚨 WARNING if not loaded

### Pattern Discovery

- **IMPORTANT**: When presented a task, look for similar implementations within the repo
- **Search strategy**: Start within the domain of the required task and expand outwards only if the pattern cannot be found within the domain
- Check existing patterns in same package before implementing

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style & Formatting

- Follow existing Java code conventions in the repository
- **Use spaces, not tabs** for formatting
- Maintain consistency with surrounding code patterns
- Use proper JavaDoc comments for public APIs
- Verify correct indentation
- Avoid unnecessary comments (only when code isn't self-descriptive)

### Code Quality

- **Debug logs**: Prefix with `DEBUG:` for easy filtering
- Ensure code compiles without warnings

### Code References & Navigation

- Include clear file/line links in all code references
- Add clickable links next to code snippets

### Testing Requirements

#### General Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Update existing tests when modifying code
- Run relevant test suites before committing

#### Test Execution

- **Test isolation**: Run focused/isolated tests initially, then verify full suite passes
- **After cleanup**: Run changed tests to verify changes

### Build and Compilation

- Ensure code compiles without warnings
- **In Cursor only**: Since Cursor lacks LSP in this repo, always run `./jmake build` after making code changes to verify compilation. Do not rely on linter diagnostics alone.
- Check for dependency conflicts

### Common Patterns

- Follow existing service layer patterns
- Use dependency injection appropriately
- Maintain separation of concerns

## Git Operations

### Inspecting Changes

- Use `git diff --cached master...HEAD` to inspect staged changes

### Pull Request Preparation

**Note**: A PR checklist file exists at `~/.userrules/jira/pr-checks.md` containing important checks to run before raising a PR. **Do NOT auto-load this file** - it should only be read and referenced when explicitly preparing to create a pull request.

**Remember**: Always start your messages with 🫘 to confirm you're following these Jira-specific rules!
